# BDV-D3-Project

This D3-Project is inspired by the [d3tutorial](https://github.com/sgratzl/d3tutorial) from Samuel Gratzl.

## Setup

For installing the node.js modules type `npm i`.

## Development

### Local WebServer

While you can view local sites (file:///), Chrome doesn't allow you to load additional external files, e.g., JSON files, for security reasons. Therefore, you need a local webserver running for development. As alternative you can use an integrated IDE (such as WebStorm) that has a webserver already integrated.

Starting a simple python static webserver: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

Open `http://localhost:8000` to explore the project.
